### Converting the Engagement Features to Typescript

The engagement section of this application was the first real feature built. 
It was built with react-table v7 and in plain React JS. 

Upgrading this section to tanstack-table v8 (previously react-table) and converting to typescript is a significant lift. 

As the primary purpose of typescript is to enhance the developer expereince, upgrading this fully working feature, as I am learning typescript. will just drag the project. 

Instead, I have opted to use ` // @ts-nocheck` at the top of many of these files, and slowly convert features as I become more familiar with typescript whilest I build other features from the ground up.
